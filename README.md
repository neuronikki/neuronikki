- 👋 Hi, I’m @neuronikki and I'm a Neuroscientist who is new to coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in how alcohol affects the functional genomics of the brain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use a program called scMappR to deconvulve bulk RNA sequencing data to infer cell-specific changes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on other neuroscience projects, like ones related to alcohol and Alzheimer's disease, specifically.
- 📫 How to reach me, email me NMaphis@salud.unm.edu
